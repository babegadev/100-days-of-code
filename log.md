### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: May 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Lil bit of a headstart. Refactored old code for my tweet bot to now use MongoDB to store last-seen-id instead of txt file.

**Thoughts**: Quite a nice refresher to headstart my second round of 100DaysOfCode. I remember when I first tried to implement the database function almost 2 years ago, I absolutely had no idea how and just gave up. But now it feels like an easy task with a bit of googling and some documentations.

### Day 1: May 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Updated my personal website to dynamically render recent projects from JSON file.

**Thoughts**: Project itself was a very good refresher for react, tho I did not refactored the whole website to use react (i used React CDN). I planned on fetching the data via an API but haven't found a suitable way to host the NodeJS api. Also, today I managed to capture my first usable NOAA satelite image with an RTL-SDR.

### Day 2: May 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the API server for projects list.

**Thoughts**: I managed to finish the API server and will be finding a way to host it online. Besides that, I build a double cross antenna for receiving NOAA satelite image better than the previous V-dipole. Will be testing out the antenna tomorrow.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
