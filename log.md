### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: May 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Lil bit of a headstart. Refactored old code for my tweet bot to now use MongoDB to store last-seen-id instead of txt file.

**Thoughts**: Quite a nice refresher to headstart my second round of 100DaysOfCode. I remember when I first tried to implement the database function almost 2 years ago, I absolutely had no idea how and just gave up. But now it feels like an easy task with a bit of googling and some documentations.

<!--- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
